# shiva 

a Go language game engine with Lua scripting 

Shiva was not started to make games, a lab to work with graphics was needed and the 
ultimate project this is spun from is sort of a graphics studio. 

A main loop that rendering graphics, responding to input, emitting sound and amenable 
to lua scripting is the goal and 'game engine' is as apt apt a term that is available. 

Shiva pulls ideas from: 

amulet(https://github.com/ianmaclarty/amulet)
engine(https://github.com/g3n/engine)
pixel(https://github.com/faiface/pixel) 

among numerous others studied to understand game engine code.

Expect broken for now, but feel free to contribute code to the first step -- getting things to work.

An abbreviated road map is as follows:

- make graphics to 'work' (the largest current hurdle)
- basic testing
- sound
- sound test basics
- refactor lua scripting
- gui
- demo app replicating g3nd(https://github.com/g3n/g3nd) in lua
